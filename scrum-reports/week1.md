# Week 1 Scrum Report


## Scrum Report Questions

**1.  What is the project focus/overall goal?**
The goal of this project is the analyze the following questions posed by the client:
- What is the total volume of requests per year or how many 311 requests is the city receiving per year?
- Which service requests are most common for the city overall AND by NEIGHBORHOOD and how is this changing year over year by SUBJECT (department), REASON,QUEUE?
- How is the case volume changing by submission channel SOURCE?
-   What is the average # of daily contacts by year? 
-   Volume of top 5 request types (TYPE)
-   Average goal resolution time by QUEUE
-   Average goal resolution time by QUEUE and neighborhood
-   What % of service requests are closed (CLOSED_DT or CASE_STATUS) vs. no data (CASE_STATUS = null) vs. unresolved (CASE_STATUS = open)?

As an extension of this project, we will explore a question further in the project. Since we have not met with the client yet, we will analyze which direction would be the most useful for the client after the first meeting.

**2. Why is this project important?**
This project is important for several reasons. First, collecting data about 311 calls can give powerful insights about equity in providing social services. Secondly, collecting data about 311 calls can allow for powerful prediction of what resources Boston residents need the most. Thirdly, 311 data can allow the city of Boston to improve fund allocation. 

**3. What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?**
The dataset provided by the city of Boston are records of every 311 call from 2011-2023 with information about subject, reason, and type of the call.

**4. What are potential limitations of the project?**
A major limitation of the project is data consistency. Many calls have missing or broadly defined attributes. This will make call classification challenging.

**5. What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the team**
